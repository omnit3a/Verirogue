TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This license applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
terms of the Verirogue Software Distribution License. The "Program", below, refers to any
such program or work, and a  a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or
any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program
or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language (Herinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

1. The Program (including the Program's source code) may be copied and distributed intact with no
modifications. The Program (including the Program's source code) may also be modified and distributed
with the modifications included. Regardless of whether or not the Program has been modified, it must
be distributed with this license included unmodified, and with full disclosure of the inclusion and
location of this license within the Program's files.

2. The Program (including the Program's source code) and all works based on the Program must
be available free of charge, if the Program is available at all. This does not exclude distribution of
the Program (including the Program's source code) as a non-free of charge work. In other words
there may be a paid version of the Program, provided that there is also a easily and readily available
distribution of the Program that is free of charge.
